# Comparative-Analysis-of-Sorting-Algorithms-using-Pthreads-and-OpenMP
Sorting algorithms are fundamental operations in computer science, essential for organizing data efficiently. This project aims to compare the performance of five sorting algorithms-Bubble Sort, Radix Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort-implemented using two parallel programming paradigms, Pthreads and OpenMP.
